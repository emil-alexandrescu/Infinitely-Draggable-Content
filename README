Dependencies:  jQuery 1.4.2 or above, jQuery UI 1.8 (Draggable) or above

Description: This plugin takes some content and makes it draggable to infinite bounds within a constrained area.
It works much like the draggable map in Google Maps.

Instructions: Simply call '$().infidrag()' on whatever element you want to make draggable.  Define the bounds
with options 'height' and 'width.'  Here's an example:

$('#content').infiDrag({
	height: 400,
	width: 600
});

Tested on IE 7 and 8, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.
